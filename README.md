Consequences of happiness were examined by sociologists, many explanations of adolescents' decisions
about crime focus either on reflective thought that discourages offending, or negative emotions -- such

because of the violent behavior resulting from drug effects.

## Project Objective
Based on the problem stated above, our aim is to analyze crime records in US and identify factors that
drive crime in the United States of America. Our solution aims to provide insights from the crime records
at the national and state levels over different period of time so that central agencies can make effective
strategies to combat crime efficiently.
